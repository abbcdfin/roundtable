# RoundTable

**The first collaborative workspace where humans and AI experts think together.**

## 🌐 Overview
RoundTable.ai is a web service that transforms standard AI chat into a structured group discussion. Users can create "Rooms," invite human colleagues via a URL, and "hire" specific LLM personas (The Architect, The Critic, The Strategist) to join the table.

## 🎯 Key User Workflows
1. **Create a Room:** Define the topic (e.g., "Q3 Market Strategy").
2. **Invite the Council:** Select specialized AI agents from a library or create custom ones.
3. **Bring Your Team:** Share a secure link with human peers.
4. **Moderated Debate:** The Moderator LLM manages the flow, ensuring everyone (AI and human) contributes and summarizing the consensus in real-time.

## 🚀 Unique Value Proposition
* **Moderated Flow:** Unlike Slack or Discord, a central LLM "Chair" prevents the conversation from drifting and ensures every participant is heard.
* **Cross-Model Diversity:** Run a room with a GPT-4o Architect, a Claude 3.5 Analyst, and a Gemini 1.5 Researcher simultaneously.
* **One-Click Consensus:** Ask the Moderator to "Call for a Vote" or "Summarize Decisions" at any point.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Backend:** FastAPI / Python for agent orchestration.
* **Real-time:** WebSockets (Socket.io) for live multi-user/multi-agent chat.
* **Orchestration:** Custom state management to handle asynchronous human input alongside LLM turns.
* **Security:** Role-based access control (RBAC) and encrypted room sessions.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [ ] MVP: Single Room with one human and two AI participants.
- [ ] Multi-user: Real-time human collaboration via shared links.
- [ ] Personas: Pre-built "Expert" templates for technical, legal, and creative tasks.
- [ ] Recording: Exportable "Minutes of the Meeting" generated by the AI Chair.
